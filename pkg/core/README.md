Unified Codex Core

This package contains the unified models, storage, and API logic for the Codex knowledge graph, plugins, and related features.
It is intended to be imported by both the CLI and the Veil web API, ensuring all interfaces use the same backend logic.

Contents:
- Models (commits, objects, entities, texts, annotations)
- Storage interfaces and backends
- Plugin interfaces and registry
- API logic for web and CLI
